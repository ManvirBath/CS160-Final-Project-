# CS160-Final-Project- Online Banking Team 1

Problem statement â€“ A new online only bank is being kickoff.  We need a web-based application server to handle normal banking transaction requests.  For example, we need to able to process account open/close, cash deposit/withdraw via ATM or check deposit with image, account transfer to/from internal or external accounts, setup automated bill payments.  You are responsible to develop the website where customer can connect via web browser as a client.  Mobile client is not required for this project.  However you are required to provide an API (e.g. web service) for remote client to credit or debit their account.  This new bank will partner with Chase bank to use their ATM machine for free of charge.  You will need to able to search all the Chase ATM locations given a starting address.Besides the customer actions, the bank manager requires a dashboard page to query or generate reports based on customer and/or account attributes (e.g. balance, zip code, ...).
